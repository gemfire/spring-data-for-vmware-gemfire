Spring Data for VMware GemFire supports `DiskStore` configuration and creation through the
`disk-store` element, as the following example shows:

```highlight
<gfe:disk-store id="Example" auto-compact="true" max-oplog-size="10"
                queue-size="50" time-interval="9999">
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/one" max-size="20"/>
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/two" max-size="20"/>
</gfe:disk-store>
```

`DiskStore` instances are used by Regions for file system persistent
backup and overflow of evicted entries as well as persistent backup for
WAN Gateways. Multiple GemFire components may share the same
`DiskStore`. Additionally, multiple file system directories may be
defined for a single `DiskStore`, as shown in the preceding example.

For an explanation of persistence, overflow, and configuration options on `DiskStore` instances, see [Persistence and Overflow](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/developing-storing_data_on_disk-chapter_overview.html) in the GemFire product documentation.
