WAN Gateways provides a way to synchronize [vmware-gemfire-short-name] Distributed
Systems across geographic locations. [spring-data-gemfire-name] provides XML namespace
support for configuring WAN Gateways as illustrated in the following
examples.

## <a id="wan-gateway-configuration-7"></a>WAN Configuration in [vmware-gemfire-short-name] 7.0

In the following example, `GatewaySenders` are configured for a
`PARTITION` Region by adding child elements (`gateway-sender` and
`gateway-sender-ref`) to the Region. A `GatewaySender` may register
`EventFilters` and `TransportFilters`.

The following example also shows a sample configuration of an
`AsyncEventQueue`, which must also be auto-wired into a Region (not
shown):

```highlight
<gfe:partitioned-region id="region-with-inner-gateway-sender" >
    <gfe:gateway-sender remote-distributed-system-id="1">
        <gfe:event-filter>
            <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.SomeEventFilter"/>
        </gfe:event-filter>
        <gfe:transport-filter>
            <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.SomeTransportFilter"/>
        </gfe:transport-filter>
    </gfe:gateway-sender>
    <gfe:gateway-sender-ref bean="gateway-sender"/>
</gfe:partitioned-region>

<gfe:async-event-queue id="async-event-queue" batch-size="10" persistent="true" disk-store-ref="diskstore"
        maximum-queue-memory="50">
    <gfe:async-event-listener>
        <bean class="example.AsyncEventListener"/>
    </gfe:async-event-listener>
</gfe:async-event-queue>

<gfe:gateway-sender id="gateway-sender" remote-distributed-system-id="2">
    <gfe:event-filter>
        <ref bean="event-filter"/>
        <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.SomeEventFilter"/>
    </gfe:event-filter>
    <gfe:transport-filter>
        <ref bean="transport-filter"/>
        <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.SomeTransportFilter"/>
    </gfe:transport-filter>
</gfe:gateway-sender>
  
<bean id="event-filter" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.AnotherEventFilter"/>
<bean id="transport-filter" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.AnotherTransportFilter"/>
```

On the other end of a `GatewaySender` is a corresponding
`GatewayReceiver` to receive Gateway events. The `GatewayReceiver` may
also be configured with `EventFilters` and `TransportFilters`, as
follows:

```highlight
<gfe:gateway-receiver id="gateway-receiver" start-port="12345" end-port="23456" bind-address="192.168.0.1">
    <gfe:transport-filter>
        <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.SomeTransportFilter"/>
    </gfe:transport-filter>
</gfe:gateway-receiver>
```

For a detailed explanation of the configuration options. see [Multi-site (WAN) Configuration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/topologies_and_comm-multi_site_configuration-chapter_overview.html) in the [vmware-gemfire-short-name] product documentation.
